# Stone-Paper-Scissor-using-C++
I wrote this C++ program while practicing programming in C++.
The core of this program lies in the random choice made by the computer. For this purpose the command used are
srand(time(NULL)); //This command generates a total random number by counting number of seconds since january 1970
move = rand % 3; //This command returns the remainder of the completely random variable upon dividing by 3 which will be either 0,1 or 2
Based on the remainder obtained the move for the computer is choses, thus ensuring a random choice by the computer.
